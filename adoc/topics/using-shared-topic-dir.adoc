= Using a Shared Topics Directory

If you have content you want to use in multiple locations, you can create subdirectory in your `adoc` folder and put your content there. From there, you can use the `include` directive to use that content.

For example, if you the following layout:

* adoc/
** index.adoc
** page1.adoc
** topics/
*** common-content.adoc

you would use the following to include `common-content.adoc` in `index.adoc` or `page1.adoc`:

[source,adoc,options="nowrap"]
----
 include::topics/using-shared-topics-dir.adoc[]
----

You can find more details on using the `include` directive in the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-directive[Asciidoctor documentation].
